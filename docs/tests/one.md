I knew that that the first option is correct but I didn't know if the costumer's phone number is also being stored or not in the orginial system.

I miss read the question and I thought I need to find the correct option instead of finding the incorrect option.

I got the second option correct but I think I didn't read the third one carefully enough to see that its said that "given the telephone number of a known criminal."

I didn't know what to chose so I pretty much guessed. But I relised that my option was wrong because you can't go back to the original image after the transformation. The third option makes more sense because it can go back to the origianl image after the transformation by backtracking the steps taken. In this example, you just need to subtract the new value from 255 and that would be the value of the pixal. Meaning that the image is restored.
