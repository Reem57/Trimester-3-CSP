I forgot that because the program is being split up and ran and different parts, there is a problem that some of teh previous code would be needed in order to compute lines of code following.

I didn't know what "citizen science" meant so I really just guessed. I now know that it requires at least an input from people from all over a certain area.

I didn't know the difference between the new (IPv6) and older (IPv4) version of the internet so I just made a guess. Now I know that it the newer version has more addresses available than the older version.

I got the last two correct but I forgot that you can also ask the user for ideas and their opinion on the user interface.

I just made a calculation error when thinking about this problem. So I said that more than 4 bits are need for the 8 directions.

I was decideding between the two and didn't know which one to pick. I thought it would make more sense because with such large numbers the count could crash

Since the name appears in both databases it makes sense that the researcher could mix up the names if they have the same name in both databases.

I didn't know what "citizen science" meant so I just guessed again. If I new what it was I would eliminate that option immediately.
