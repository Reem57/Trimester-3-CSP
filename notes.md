 5.1 Beneficial & Harmful Effects

People create computing innovations

The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations

Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance

    A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person

    Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts

Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended: 

    The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community 

    Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels

    Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals

Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture 

Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses

It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used

Computing innovations have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields

Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer

Questions:

1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

3 beneficial effects of coding are the convenience that its processes provide, like simplifying data and providing information, the improvement of jobs as well as providing new ones in the technology of computing, and also it also allows people to communicate over long distances, making collaboration among teams easier.

3 harmful effects of coding are the increasing costs for products in the technology/computing industry, leading to an increase in the Digital Divide, it discourages communication face to face with other because the use of technology is easier than creating more personal experiences, and finally the possible advancement of technology means a larger scale of danger in war scenarios.

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Dopamine is a real issue, as dopamine is very addicting. Every human is prone to seeking out things that make them happy, and that is what dopamine is. If a certain thing gives you a constant amount of dopamine, you're likely to become addicted to it, which would impact your life in numerous ways. It would affect sleep schedules and social lives, should you spend too much time doing it, and it would eventually affect how you perform in school. This can be seen in myself through playing too many games rather than studying, which is severely affecting my sleep schedule, but it definitely isn't as bad as Anthony Rosner.
 5.2 Digital Divide

Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries

The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics

    The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals

    The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally

    The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments

Questions:

1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

Somebody in the digital world might empower themself by seeking out options to get involved in the digital world. For example taking advantage of school chromebooks should you not have any, would allow you the proper access in the digital world, then becoming more knowledgeable about technology as a whole would empower them.

2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

Somebody that is empowered could seek out opportunities others that aren't empowered could take advantage of. At Del Norte, this would involve the chromebooks, and somebody who is empowered could help ensure that everybody without the best access to technology uses the chromebooks to their full advantage.

3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

There is red tape blocking digital empowerment everywhere, with the biggest being having the money to acquire this digit
