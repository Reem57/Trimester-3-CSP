<h2> 5.1 Beneficial & Harmful Effects </h2>
<a>
    
    People create computing innovations
    
    The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
    
    Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
    
        A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people, or even by the same person
    
        Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
    
    Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended: 
    
        The World Wide Web was originally intended only for rapid and easy exchange of information within the scientific community 
    
        Targeted advertising is used to help businesses, but it can be misused at both individual and aggregate levels
    
        Machine learning and data mining have enabled innovation in medicine, business, and science, but information discovered in this way has also been used to discriminate against groups of individuals
    
    Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture 
    
    Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses
    
    It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used
    
    Computing innovations have often had unintended beneficial effects by leading to advances in other fields
    
    Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer

    Questions:
    
    1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
    
    3 beneficial effects of coding are the convenience that its processes provide, like simplifying data and providing information, the improvement of jobs as well as providing new ones in the technology of computing, and also it also allows people to communicate over long distances, making collaboration among teams easier.
    
    3 harmful effects of coding are the increasing costs for products in the technology/computing industry, leading to an increase in the Digital Divide, it discourages communication face to face with other because the use of technology is easier than creating more personal experiences, and finally the possible advancement of technology means a larger scale of danger in war scenarios.
    
    2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
    
    Dopamine is a real issue, as dopamine is very addicting. Every human is prone to seeking out things that make them happy, and that is what dopamine is. If a certain thing gives you a constant amount of dopamine, you're likely to become addicted to it, which would impact your life in numerous ways. It would affect sleep schedules and social lives, should you spend too much time doing it, and it would eventually affect how you perform in school. This can be seen in myself through playing too many games rather than studying, which is severely affecting my sleep schedule, but it definitely isn't as bad as Anthony Rosner.
<h2> 5.2 Digital Divide </h2>
<a>
    
    Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
    
    The “digital divide” refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
    
        The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
    
        The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
    
        The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments
<a>
    
    Questions:
    
    1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
    
    Somebody in the digital world might empower themself by seeking out options to get involved in the digital world. For example taking advantage of school chromebooks should you not have any, would allow you the proper access in the digital world, then becoming more knowledgeable about technology as a whole would empower them.
    
    2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
    
    Somebody that is empowered could seek out opportunities others that aren't empowered could take advantage of. At Del Norte, this would involve the chromebooks, and somebody who is empowered could help ensure that everybody without the best access to technology uses the chromebooks to their full advantage.
    
    3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
    
    There is red tape blocking digital empowerment everywhere, with the biggest being having the money to acquire this digital empowerment. At Del Norte, they offer ways to circumvent this red tape by providing technology in classes and with chromebooks, which would allow the digital empowerment of individuals who hadn't previously. Other sources also provide options for the unempowered, by having plenty of options to obtain old and unneeded technology for empowering, but isn't offered everywhere.
    
<h2> 5.3 Computing Bias </h2>
    
<a>
    
    Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
    
    Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
    
    Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development

    Questions
    
    Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
    
    No because I believe they simply just didn't account for the variablity in skin color. They likely just didnt test this.
   
    How do you think this happened?
    
    I believe this happened due to lack of proper testing on darker skin colors.
    
    Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
    
    It is harmful to those that are affected, however it was not made to be harmful, and it's intention was meant to be beneficial rather than harmful.
    
    Should it be corrected?
    
    I do believe it should be corrected, as the population affected is excluded from the features of the program in the computer.
    
    What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
    
    I would try to fix it by running tests until darker skins coul dbe accounted for in the program's detection of faces.
<h2> 5.4: Crowdsourcing </h2>
<a>
        
    Public Data Sets:
    
    - Kaggle
    
    - Google Public Datasets
    
    - Data.gov
    
    - Local Government
    
    Widespread access to info and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions and dissemination of results.
    
    Distributed Computing:
    
    - A ton of computers do 1 task
    
    Examples:
    
    - Spotify with collab playlists
    
    - Crowdfunding like kickstarter and GoFundMe
    
    - Blockchain like crypto and other tokens

    Questions
    
    CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
    
    A crowdsource idea might be to have one big collaborative github project/repo, where every team is working on a seperate part of a lrager project, which would benefit the environment by pushing it out to family and friends and serving its purpose.
    
    What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

    DNHS crowdsourcing is directing material and classes to better benefit the student majority. The final project could be better with crowdsourcing if we correctly display info based on our client.
